- 👋 Hello, I am Md. Ferdous Wahid from Bangladesh and I work as an assistant professor in the civil engineering department at Sonargaon University, one of the most prominent private universities in the nation. 

- 👀 I am interested in structural engineering, specifically in the probabilistic risk assessment of infrastructure systems subjected to natural and manmade hazards, the application of statistics, machine learning, OpenSees or other high-fidelity finite element software in structural engineering, performance based design of structures, earthquake wind and blast resistant design of tall structures, soil-fluid-structure dynamic interactions.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning statistics, python, machine learning, and OpenSees.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on the research on the application of statistics and machine learning in structural engineering.
